# Introduction

This repository represents a starting point for cultivated field detection and instance segmentation.

It is based on [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection). MMDetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. It is
a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

The dataset [AI4Boundaries from the EU Joint Research Center](https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset/0e79ce5d-e4c8-4721-8773-59a4acf2c9c9) has been considered,
containing several thousands multispectral and multitemporal images from the Sentinel-2 satellite constellation.
